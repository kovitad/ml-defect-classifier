Machine Learning Model for Defect Classification â€“ Proof of Concept

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is a proof of concept for applying machine learning to classify test execution failures into predefined defect categories.
It demonstrates:

Parsing and analyzing automated test reports (XML/JSON).

Training a machine learning model (Random Forest) to classify defects.

Exposing a lightweight API for integration into CI/CD pipelines.

(Optional) Automating defect logging into an issue tracker such as Jira.

The goal is to reduce manual triage, improve defect visibility, and catch issues earlier in the release pipeline.

ðŸ“‚ Data Source

Test Results: Sampled from multiple application teams (unit, API, UI automated tests).

Data Extraction: Failed test execution results parsed into CSV (~47k records in the POC).

ðŸ§© Defect Categories

The model classifies failures into categories such as:

Coding Error â€“ Functional

Coding Error â€“ GUI

Coding Error â€“ Interface/API

Test Execution Error

Infrastructure Error

Test Data Error

Deployment Error

Non-Functional Error (e.g., performance, resource usage)

Unknown / Not a Defect (requires human investigation)

ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Model

Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier (initial POC).

Features: Test case names, error messages, log content.

Pipeline: Log parsing â†’ feature engineering â†’ model training â†’ classification.

Evaluation: Accuracy measured on historical labeled test logs.

ðŸ”— Workflow Integration

Data Preparation: Convert XML/JSON reports into structured CSV datasets.

Model Training: Train and validate the ML model on labeled data.

API Service: Wrap the model in a Flask API (Dockerized).

CI/CD Integration: Call the API from pipelines to classify test failures in real time.

Defect Logging (Optional): Use REST APIs (e.g., Jira) to automatically log classified defects.

ðŸš€ Tech Stack

Languages/Frameworks: Python, scikit-learn, Flask

Containerization: Docker

Pipelines: Jenkins/GitHub Actions (for CI/CD integration)

Issue Tracking (optional): Jira REST API

ðŸ“… Roadmap

MVP (Short Term):

Rule-based + Random Forest classification

Automated defect logging with simple categories

Future Enhancements (Long Term):

Use LLMs for flexible log analysis

Improve accuracy with active learning & semi-supervised approaches

Establish full MLOps pipeline (e.g., MLflow, model versioning, retraining)

âœ… Benefits

Automation: Reduces manual triage of test failures.

Consistency: Standardized defect classification across teams.

Speed: Faster defect feedback before UAT.

Scalability: Easy to plug into existing pipelines.
